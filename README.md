# Micro-cloud -- A mini framework built on top of FastAPI

This codebase contains a mini framework built on top of FastAPI as a micro framework for faster API services development.

The primary objective it to increase the speed with which engineers can roll out API endpoints for apps, 
regardless of the side and complexity. It achieves this by abstracting away boilerplate functionality like:

- CRUD operations in a database agnostic way
- Request / Response handling (including filtering, searching, sorting, data validation and exception handling)
- Business logic abstraction
